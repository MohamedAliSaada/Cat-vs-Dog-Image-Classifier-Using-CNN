# Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classifier-Using-CNN
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images as either Cat (0) or Dog (1) using a subset of the Bingsu/Cat_and_Dog dataset from Hugging Face. The model is trained from scratch and evaluated using both training metrics and visual testing on real images.
