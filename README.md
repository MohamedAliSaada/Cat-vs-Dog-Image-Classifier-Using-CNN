# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier Using CNN

This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images as either **Cat (0)** or **Dog (1)** using a subset of the `Bingsu/Cat_and_Dog` dataset from Hugging Face. The model is trained from scratch and evaluated using both training metrics and visual testing on real images.

* `Conv2D(64, 3x3) + ReLU + MaxPooling2D`
* `Conv2D(128, 3x3) + ReLU + MaxPooling2D`
* `Flatten`
* `Dense(64) + ReLU + Dropout(0.5)`
* `Dense(32) + ReLU + Dropout(0.5)`
* `Dense(1) + Sigmoid`  *(binary classification)*

Optimizer: **AdamW**
Loss: **Binary Crossentropy**
Metric: **Accuracy**

## üìä Training Results

The model was trained for 15 epochs on 4000 images using an 90/10 train-validation split and batch size of 128.

![Training Metrics](fit_results.png)

* Training accuracy reached above 92%
* Validation accuracy plateaued around 66%
* Overfitting is visible from increasing validation loss

---

## üîç Evaluation Results on New Images

We evaluated 6 unseen images (3 cats, 3 dogs). Predictions were:

![Module Test Samples](module_test.png)

* **Cats misclassified as dogs** in 2 out of 3 cases
* **Dogs correctly classified** in all 3 cases

> The model is biased towards classifying dogs correctly, potentially due to data imbalance or features learned more distinctly from dogs.

---

## ‚ùå Limitations

* Slight overfitting: dropout used but may not be sufficient
* Model struggles with some cat images due to color/texture
* Performance can improve with data augmentation or pretrained features

---

## ‚úÖ Future Improvements

* Use more data (full dataset or larger sample)
* Apply data augmentation (flip, rotate, zoom, etc.)
* Try transfer learning (e.g. MobileNet, VGG16)
* Use class balancing techniques if needed
